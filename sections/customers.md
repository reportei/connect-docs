Customers
======

In this API, customers refer to your users or clients. You, as the merchant, can use the API to manage your customers and their integrations. When dealing with customer-specific data, youâ€™ll need to include an additional authentication header (x-customer-token), which identifies the specific customer whose data you are accessing. This token ensures secure access to customer data and is required for all customer-related requests.

Endpoints:
