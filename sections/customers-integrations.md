Customers Integrations
======

Customer integrations refer to the connections your customers establish with various platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and others the, see [Show merchant settings](#merchant-settings) to check available integrations.

When interacting with customer integrations, youâ€™ll use the x-customer-token for secure access to customer-specific data.

**Customer Integration Status**: Every customer integration is prompted to be expired or have the token revoked by the customer, with that, you can check the `status` field of the customer integration to check if the integration is active. See the [Show a customer integration](#show-a-customer-integration) for more status details.

Endpoints:

- [Create a customer integration session](#create-a-customer-integration-session)
- [Show a customer integration](#show-a-customer-integration)
- [Delete a customer integration](#delete-a-customer-integration)

Create a customer integration session
--------------

This endpoint allows you to create a session for customers to manage and integrate their networks. The session acts like a "checkout" process, where the customer can view existing integrations and other available networks for integration.

* `POST /customer-integrations/session` will return an object containing the session details, including a session link (`session_link`) that the customer will use to access their integration management page.

**Optional parameters**: `redirect_url` Url that shows up in the button at the footer of the web page, used as a final redirect after the customer finishes integrating the accounts.

**Authorization**: Both the `Authorization` header (Bearer token) and customer api_token (`x-customer-token`) must be provided in the request headers.

**Session Expiry**: The session has a duration of `5 minutes`, after that if the link is accessed, `401 Unauthorized` will be returned.

**Session Link**: Once a session is generated, you might access or redirect the customer to `session_link`, this will display the web page where the user will be able to manage current and new integrations.
